*** Invest time in stable requirements ( or implement incremental change policy, deliver final program in increments)

*** Don't rush to programming, try out several designs first

*** Use Pseudocode Programming Process (PPP)

*** Defensive Programming

*** Readable working solution first, performance measurements second, and optimisations last

*** Keep Notes: 
	Feature parking lot
	Refactoring parking lot
	Defect list
	Simple measurements list ( nr of defects, lines of code, nr work hours, total euro spent) 

*** Spend time to learn (1h / day min)
